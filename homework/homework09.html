    <h1>Homework 9: GEE Analysis Pt3</h1>

    <h3>Instructions: GEE Remote Sensing Presentation</h3>
    <p>
        The last homework will be a presentation on different satellites. Go to the following form in Google Sheets
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EjKj_N9Vfj_gQR0YPvxqlDXZLFJFNblCZn08T45SMvI/edit?usp=sharing"> (link) </a>and enter your name next to a sensor. If a student has already taken the sensor
        you wanted, you will have to look for another one in the list.
    </p>
    <p>Students will present a short description of the satellite sensor and its application. You are expected to find
        at least one peer-reviewed paper showing the application of the sensor. <b>You need to read the article not just
        the abstract.</b> Describe how the researchers used the
        sensor in their research and use figures from the paper to describe what the researchers did. Finally, make a GEE map using the satellite imagery: ideally it would be a map that
        demonstrates the application of the satellite sensors. The map should have the layers with appropriate titles
        and the satellite image should have been clipped to a state, county or city boundary. Upload your presentation
        as a Google Slides Presentation and put the link in the  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EjKj_N9Vfj_gQR0YPvxqlDXZLFJFNblCZn08T45SMvI/edit?usp=sharing"> Google Sheets </a>. You are
        expected to submit the link to your code for the homework, however, for the sake of having more time to discuss
        the sensor application, please do not plan to run GEE during your presentation. Instead make a print-screen of
        the map and show it as an image in your presentation.
    </p>
    <p>Each student will have 5 minutes to present their work, and students in the audience are expected to participate.
        Every student should be present during the days of presentations. I will upload a roster on the order of the
        presentation. Also, students are expected to take notes, since the final exam will include questions based on
        these presentations. Before the deadline, upload the link to your Google Slides and the link to the GEE map in
        Sakai.
