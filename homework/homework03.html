<h1>Homework 3: Georeference image</h1>

<h3>Instructions: Turn in a static map based on an image of UNC that you georeference, an interactive tilemap based on the georeferenced image, and the control points used to georeference the image</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Watch the <a href="../pages/section2.html#C5">tutorial videos</a> on how to georeference an image, make tiles and upload it to GitHub.</li>
    <li>Use the following data to complete the homework: the <a href="https://sakai.unc.edu/x/0E43jI"> High Resolution Orthoimagery</a> (the same as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIel0V-MNe4"> video example</a>) and a <a href="https://sakai.unc.edu/x/idDsF9">topographical map that has not been georeferenced</a> from 1993 without a reference.</a></li>
    <li>Create a map of the georeferenced topographical image, with the high resolution orthoimage in the background. Include the scale, north, title and your name. </li>
    <li>Convert the georeferenced image to a tile layer, and upload the tiles and HTML to GitHub. <em>Be sure that the map can be seen from any computer connected to the internet, and that the page is not only working locally on your computer.</em></li>
    <li>Save the control points (at least 6 points) as a text file and upload them to your GitHub</li>
    <li>Before the deadline upload to Sakai the link to your tilemap and a link to your control points</li>
</ul>
