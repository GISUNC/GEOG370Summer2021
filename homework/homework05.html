    <h1>Homework 5: Census data ratios and categories</h1>

    <h3>Instructions: Make a choropleth based on ratios and using 3 different classification schemes</h3>
    <p>Using the same data as the previous homework (HW4), create a ratio and produce 3 maps using 3 different modes of
        categorizing the data in QGIS. For each map add a title that describes the ratio and the mode used to categorize
        the data. Create a Google Slides presentation that includes the maps and explain the ratio that you did and the reason for creating that ratio. Also discuss the
        pros and cons for each classification scheme.</p>
    <p>You will upload the link to your presentation and upload the presentation as a pdf on Sakai</a>
