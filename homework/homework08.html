<h1>Homework 8: GEE Analysis Pt1</h1>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>On GEE, upload a point, line or polygon layer related to a topic of your interest (you can use data from your HW7 or HW6). Also upload a polygon of a city or county boundary that contains the vector layer you added. Create a distance raster from the vector of interest and clip the distance raster to the city or county boundary.   Make a map centered on the area that you are presenting. The map should present the clipped distance layer and the uploaded vector. The distance raster should have a well-chosen color palette, and each layer should be properly labeled (e.g.: the layers in the layer control should not be named “Layer 1”).
