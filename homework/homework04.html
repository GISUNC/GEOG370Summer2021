    <h1>Homework 4: Census data choropleth</h1>

    <h3>Instructions: Make a choropleth with the county dataset of another state besides NC</h3>
    <p>Using census data that does not fall under the topics of “housing” or “population and people”. Videos 4h to 4j
        are the most related to this homework. The final map should have a state or UTM projection and should not be in
        a default projection like EPSG 4326 or in a global projection like 3857. The map does not need a scale or north
        (often choropleths do not benefit from a scale or north). However, the scale should be clear and should have
        text related to the variable being displayed. Do not leave the default names of the file to be displayed in the
        legend. The color gradient of the map should not be blue nor red (these colors are often related to political
        parties in the US). The map should have a title and your name. Upload the map to Sakai. Include a few sentences related to the topic that is presented in the map and indicate the source of your data..
