<h1>Homework 7: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>

<h3>Instructions: Answer a real-world question using geoprocessing tools </h3>
<p>Make a map that requires the use of <b>at least two </b>different geoprocessing tools to answer a “real-world” question. For example, you could use buffer() and intersect() with a  river layer and conservation areas to answer the question “What fraction of riparian buffers are conserved ?”
    You should find your data online and define your own question.
    Upload your map and submit the links to your data sources and to the new datasets that you make.  Indicate (on Sakai) the methods that you used and the questions that you answered with your analysis. 
    You will be evaluated based on your creativity and your incorporation of elements of cartographic design already discussed in class. If two students come up with the same example, they will both lose creativity points.
