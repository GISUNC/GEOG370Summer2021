    <h3>If you are interested, here a short rant about why I decided to use this software for GEOG370 </h3>
    <p>
        For more than 50% of the class we will use QGIS. This is one of several software packages out there that allow you to accomplish the tasks of editing, managing, analyzing or displaying geographic information. The most popular options that allow you to do all these tasks in one place are QGIS and ARCGIS. At UNC I have decided to use QGIS because it works easily on both Mac and PCs. We will use other software for specific tasks: For remote sensing, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is becoming the most efficient and powerful way to analyze large datasets. To share your data and maps, there is no more transparent tool than Github. 
        
        There are many other software tools that will surpass QGIS and ARCGIS in spatial analysis, managing large datasets, editing and displaying geographic data. For example, I personally prefer R for spatial analysis and tabular data cleaning, Whitebox for doing watershed research, GEE and Python using opensource libraries to analyze remote sensing imagery, Agisoft for making point clouds and orthomosaics from drone imagery, Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator for making pretty maps, and the leaflet library in JavaScript for making webmaps.  I have my (very opinionated) reasons for preferring each of these software tools that I will not share here, but you might notice a recurring theme of open source (with the exception of Adobe products).
        
        My main reasons to teach with QGIS, and not ESRI ARCGIS, is that QGIS is (1) free and (2) works on Mac and PC. ARCGIS does not work on a Mac without some kind of virtual machine or emulator installed. VM alternatives like parallels, VirtualBox, or a windows installation on your mac are usually time consuming or demand a lot of your computer's memory and processing power (believe me, I have done it).  During my first GEOG370 course at UNC I was ready to teach using ESRI products since UNC has free licenses for students, but since most students used Mac computers, I decided to switch.  Luckily, I had already taught withs QGIS a few years before in Puerto Rico. At my institution in Puerto Rico, students did not have free licenses, and had PC laptops or desktops in their houses. The GIS computer lab at that institution was closed after 5pm and during weekends. Like anything in life, learning how to manage geographic information requires practice, so I transitioned to a new software for the sake of allowing my students to have more freedom to find time to practice and to do their homework.   My former UNC students have generally been glad to have learned how to use QGIS, as some end up working for small non-profit organizations or others with few resources. Knowing open source software give you the flexibility to start geographic information research without having to pay for licenses. 

        For all those reasons, I use QGIS in this class and strongly believe that it is the right tool to teach the basic concepts of geographic information.  But just in case you are curious, I still use ESRI products, especially for georeferencing. While it clearly takes me a little longer now to find the buttons and tools in other software, the fact that I know the concepts allows me to find the tools in other software if needed. 
        To conclude, you should not think about this class as a QGIS class or even a GIS class. This course is called Introduction to Geographic Information, and the idea is for you to have a broad understanding of the current ways to manage, edit, analyze and display geographic information. The concepts that you will learn can be applied to any software, and you will be surprised how familiar the tools will look in any software package you use.
